# Word Cloud

*NOTE:* This isn't finished yet. I started with my word cloud methods and moved them into this project and I am now working on the UI part. See `notes.txt` for more information.

Implementing a word cloud using canvas and my own *word cloud algorithm*. Built with vanilla JS utilizing the latest ES6 features.


## To Use
I'm using the bloated `generator-gulp-webapp` for this so there's a lot of boiler plate dependencies.

- clone project to your working directory.
- you will need npm and bower
- run `npm install`
- run `bower install`
- to compile the JS run `gulp babel`
- to use locally run `gulp serve`
