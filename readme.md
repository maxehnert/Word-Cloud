# Word Cloud

Implementing a word cloud using d3, canvas and my own *word cloud algorithm*. Built with babel/es6.


## To Use
I'm using the bloated generator-gulp-webapp for this so there's a lot of dependencies.

- clone project to your working directory.
- you will need npm, bower, gulp
- run `npm install`
- run `bower install`
- to compile the JS run `gulp babel`
- to launch the page `gulp serve`
