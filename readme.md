# Word Cloud

**Note:** This isn't finished yet. I started with my word cloud methods and moved them into this project and I am now working on the UI part. See `notes.txt` for more information.

#### However the project *is* live to try out. There are just a few bugs and features I'm still working on.
Implementing a word cloud using canvas and my own *word cloud algorithm*. Built with vanilla JS utilizing the latest ES6 features.

## To Run Locally
**Note:** I'm using the bloated `generator-gulp-webapp` for this so there's a lot of boiler plate dependencies.

- clone project to your working directory.
- you will need npm and bower
- run `npm install`
- run `bower install`
- to compile the JS run `gulp babel`
- to use locally run `gulp serve`
