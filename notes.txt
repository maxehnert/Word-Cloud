Road Map

- Font size are too big right now. I need to have a real structure for font size.

- I'm still only keeping 10 words so I can more easily work with the data, but would like to increase which will affect the next point.

- I need to have realistic structure to placing the words in the canvas element without overlap.

- It needs to 'look random' but not actually be random. When it is random, they group too much. I need them to be randomly placed but each time remove the possibility of using the space that was already taken by the previous words.

*Note: Jason Davies states this for his word cloud: Instead, we draw each word to a hidden canvas element, and retrieve the pixel data.
