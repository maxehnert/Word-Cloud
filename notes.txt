Road Map

- I'm still only keeping 10 words so I can more easily work with the data, but would like to increase which will affect the next point.

- I need to have realistic structure to placing the words in the canvas element without overlap.

- It needs to 'look random' but not actually be random. When it is random, they group too much. I need them to be randomly placed but each time remove the possibility of using the space that was already taken by the previous words.

- If I create separate canvas elements for each word I can then place them in the single large canvas and before placing the next one run a check to make sure there is no overlap.

- if all of them are true then there is overlap. if just one of them is false then there is no overlap
[
  if (RectA.X1 < RectB.X2 &&
      RectA.X2 > RectB.X1 &&
      RectA.Y1 < RectB.Y2 &&
      RectA.Y2 > RectB.Y1)
]

Let's build some dimensions:

Main canvas is width: 1000, height: 500

dimensions from positionArr:

canvas['id’]: ‘starting'
canvas['width’]: 528
canvas['height’]: 149
positionX: 44
positionY: 455

X
44 through (44 + 528)

Y
455 through (455 + 149)

Top Left:
44, 455

Top Right:
(44 + 528), 455

Bottom Left:
44, (455 + 149)

Bottom Right:
(44 + 528), (455 + 149)

1. create individual canvas elements for each word. - done
 2. store them in an array
 - done
3. map over the array and place them all in 1 new large canvas
- done
4. using the above check to make sure there is no overlap
- done
5. Check to make sure the full word in inside the main canvas element
6. Make it efficient!
