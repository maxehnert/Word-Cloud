Road Map

- Font size are too big right now. I need to have a real structure for font size.

- I'm still only keeping 10 words so I can more easily work with the data, but would like to increase which will affect the next point.

- I need to have realistic structure to placing the words in the canvas element without overlap.

- It needs to 'look random' but not actually be random. When it is random, they group too much. I need them to be randomly placed but each time remove the possibility of using the space that was already taken by the previous words.

*Note: Jason Davies states this for his word cloud: Instead, we draw each word to a hidden canvas element, and retrieve the pixel data.

Found another example word cloud that uses the same approach but with the help of an external library. This is the simplest approach I can think of currently.

- Going by the above if I create separate canvas elements for each word I can then place them in the single large canvas and before placing the next one run a check to make sure there is no overlap.
[
  if (RectA.X1 < RectB.X2 &&
      RectA.X2 > RectB.X1 &&
      RectA.Y1 < RectB.Y2 &&
      RectA.Y2 > RectB.Y1)
]

- 16px to 1em so multiply em by 16 to get total pixel height of word.
- 11px to 1rem; everything I can find says rem is the same height-to-pixel as em but I'm seeing a difference in 5px.

1. create individual canvas elements for each word. - done
 2. store them in an array
 - done
3. map over the array and place them all in 1 new large canvas
- done
4. using the above check to make sure there is no overlap
5. ???
6. new project
